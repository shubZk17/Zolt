Zolt — AI-Powered Frontend Development Environment

Zolt is an AI-assisted frontend development environment that runs entirely in your browser. It transforms natural language prompts into React + TypeScript + Tailwind components, with a smooth developer experience powered by Vite and the Monaco Editor.
(I built the interface myself, with some help from AI for parts of the design and setup.)

✨ Current Features

Natural Language → Code: Generate functional React components from plain English.

AI Assistance: Smart code suggestions and completions.

Monaco Editor: VS Code–like editing with syntax highlighting.

Live Preview: Side-by-side editor and rendered output.

File Management: Create and organize multiple project files.

🔮 Roadmap

Zolt is frontend-only right now. Planned additions:

Backend APIs (Node.js, Express)

Database integrations (Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

Authentication & Payments (Clerk, Auth0, Stripe)

Mobile apps (React Native with Expo)

🛠️ Tech Stack

React • TypeScript • Vite • Tailwind CSS
